## Motivation
After a few months of regularly playing Wordle, I found the game extremely fun and intuitive to play. Intuitive, mostly because of what the game does and doesn't allow. Wordle allows no input except for letters, either by keyboard or button clicks. It restricts player to only one row at a time, and 5 letters each. It also doesn't allow for random string of letters, which it rejects as an 'invalid word'. As such, it subtly forces the player to earnestly guess a 5-letter word in maximum of 6 tries, in a rule not dissimilar to Mastermind. Thus, the simplicity of the game architecture coupled with its sleek CSS design makes for a compelling challenge for me to build a Wordle clone.

This project has given me the opportunity to learn more about animation and @keyframes in CSS, as well as timing the animation using setTimeout in JavaScript.
